# Learning_tool_app
Added a question addition mode. The user is prompted to enter a question, which is saved after a simple input check. The user can continue entering new questions until they input "main_menu." Afterward, the list of prepared questions is saved in a CSV file. Two types of questions can be added.

Switching the question activity mode is implemented. Upon entering the mode, a greeting is displayed, and the list of questions is printed. The table appearance needs improvement. The toggle between active/inactive is functional. TODO: Verify question deletion functionality.

Main menu: Users are prompted to enter the mode number, and the corresponding function is invoked.
